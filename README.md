<h1>Problem</h1>

The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. Write a program to enter the limit capacity of the knapsack, a number of items together with its weight and values. Use knapsack strategy to find the most valuable items picked.
